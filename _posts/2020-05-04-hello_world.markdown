As our cohort begins our first steps on the exciting journey towards learning code, I wanted to title my first blog post appropriately and in the spirit of the field of programming.

Personally, I've always been deeply interested by computers, having grown up seeing the vast advancements that the union of software and hardware have brought about since the days of punch-cards and vacuum tubes. Many hours were spent in my childhood, on my floor, tinkering with computer hardware well into the night. Even so, computer science has always seemed esoteric and highly abstract to me, in part due to my lack of confidence in mathematics. That kept me away from diving too deep into computer science as a subject. I chose Flatiron School as a path towards learning practical knowledge for a future career switch where I can synthesize my knowledge in finance as well as programming, the junction of which is something I want to pursue further.


Having done programming in stops and starts throughout the last 6-7 years or so, both inside and outside of school, the early topics in Flatiron so far have been relatively simple to move through. I'm excited for the challenges that come ahead during this course, and will outline my progress and thoughts in a later post.

To my fellow students in this cohort, I'm very excited to be beginning this course with you, and I hope it will offer us many chances to work and learn together, whatever our end goals may be. Best of luck and cheers!
