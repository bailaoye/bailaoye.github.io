So far in our cohort, we've built a solid understanding of the basic logic underpinning Ruby applications and dug into the nitty gritty of many of its pre-built methods. That being said, in the second unit it is much easier to intuitively know which method is needed to implement a particular idea or logical flow. Having scratched my head at exactly why we needed to code out methods that Ruby provides by default, I now have a much better appreciation for the building blocks of Ruby knowledge we accumulated in the previous unit.

However, even though we can write a Ruby app with a simple interface, we still have no idea how to persist the data in those apps beyond the temporary variables/namespace they 'live' in. This unit introduces us to SQL and ActiveRecord, and is the first step to storing data in a database structure and how that links up with the Internet at large. I'm looking forward to filling this gap in my understanding and be on my way to creating my first web app!
