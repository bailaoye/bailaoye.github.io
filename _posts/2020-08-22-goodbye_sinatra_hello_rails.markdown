Two weeks and 65 commits later, my Sinatra Portfolio Project is now done. For this project, we were required to build a CRUD app using RESTful routes, and as such this project could pass for our first foray into 'full-stack' web development during our course. While my app is rather rudimentary and only covers the basics, it has given me a much more solid understanding of several concepts in software development, MVC being a key example. 

Although throughout this unit I sometimes became frustrated with the amount of manual fiddling required to get Sinatra to work properly - the knowledge of the basic structure and functions of a web app and how to implement them manually is invaluable experience that we will now carry onto the next unit, which focuses on Ruby on Rails. Having been quite stuck at various points during this project, I now realize the value in learning Sinatra before Rails, and hope to build upon that knowledge and create a Rails app for the next project that I can truly be proud of.
