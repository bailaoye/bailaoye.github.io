The coronavirus pandemic this year has pushed us all towards new methods for communicating and getting work done at home. As someone who tends to work best when away from home in an environment with fewer distractions, the restrictions that COVID-19 has brought about have been an interesting adjustment for me to say the least. 

So far in our course, we have been delving into the basics of Ruby. Having taken college computer science courses in Java and Python, I'm able to draw many parallels between the structures and syntax of those languages with that of Ruby. It is clear that matz, the creator of Ruby, wanted to make a language that would allow programmers to easily and quickly convert their ideas into executable code. The syntactic "sugar" included in Ruby has been very helpful at the moment as we are still learning the ropes.

I look forward to the upcoming CLI project and to applying the methods we've learned so far to create a working program.
